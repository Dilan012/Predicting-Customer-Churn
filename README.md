# Predicting Customer Churn

This project aims to predict customer churn in banks using various machine learning models and ensemble techniques.

## Team
- Samuditha Saradindu
- Dilan Madhusankha

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can identify customers likely to churn, evaluate model performance, and provide actionable insights to banks.

## Objectives
- Develop models for predicting customer churn.
- Evaluate model performance.
- Provide insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
- **Features:**
  - `credit_score`
  - `country`
  - `gender`
  - `age`
  - `tenure`
  - `account_balance`
  - `products_number`
  - `credit_card`
  - `active_member`
  - `estimated_salary`
- **Target Variable:** `churn` (whether the customer has churned)
